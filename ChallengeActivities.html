        <p class = "P1">This challenge activity was fun and exciting to learn and work on my new html and css skills I have started to develop
            I learned a lot from it. And I think that the website will only get better and better the more assignemtns I post to it over
            the course of the semester. This challenged me in CSS and I can't wait to continue to learn more and become better in my web 
            development. The most fun thing I liked about this project was all of the linking between websites and to the other links to other projects. 
            I think it is cool that you can link a picture or words to any other website.
