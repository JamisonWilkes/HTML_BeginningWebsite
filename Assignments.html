        <h1>The Assignments</h1>
        <p class = "P1">There are many different activities and assingments that I will
             be doing throughout this course. Here are just some different
            ones that we will be doing </p>
        
        <h3>Learning Activities</h3>
        <p class = "P1">These activities teach the topics covered in each module. They can be completed as you work through the instructional videos. They follow along with the material presented in the textbook.
         Learning activities are scored for completion (i.e. Did you make a valid attempt at completing the activity). The learning activities provide a way to learn the material by doing.</p>
        <h3>Try It Out Actvities</h3>
        <p class = "P1">These activities give you a chance to practice the skills we are learning. These activities include written instructions for completing the activity. 
            The try it out activities are worth 15% of your grade and will help boost your score while you are practicing the skills just learned. They are lightly graded with a focus on completion. </p>
        <h3>Challenge Activiites</h3>
        <p class = "P1">The challenge activities are how you demonstrate mastery of the topics. These activities are designed to use the skills outlined in the learning objectives.
            The points earned on the challenge activities make up 50% of your grade. These activities are used to demonstrate mastery. Challenge activities are graded on completing the activity, meeting all the requirements, and on the quality of the result. </p>
